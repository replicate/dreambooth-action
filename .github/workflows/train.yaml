      model-name:
        required: true
        description: The name of the Replicate model to publish, in the format `your-replicate-username/desired-model-name`. If the model doesn't already exist, it will be created automatically.
      prompt-identifier:
        required: true
        description: A short string representing your custom trained style or concept. This should be an uncommon string of letters like `zxz`, rather than a common word or name like `sarah` of `dog`. You'll use this string in prompts when running the model like "a pencil sketch of zxz sitting in a meadow".
        default: zxz
      max-train-steps:
        required: true
        description: Total number of training steps to perform. Higher numbers produce more accurate results, but take longer to run. Set this to something low like 100 to test that your workflow is working, then run again at a higher number like 2000 to train more accurately.
        type: number
        default: 2000
